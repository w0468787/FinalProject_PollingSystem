# FinalProject_PollingSystem
Polling System
to use this project, (if you dont have the PollingSystem DB) you have to uncomment things in the dbBuilder.php and run that first to create the DB
after that i created a new column called vote count in the results table using PHPMyAdmin (largely useless, I couldnt manage the database logic and what not pre due date)
once thats setup you should be able to start properly through the index which will bring you to the welcome page where you decide what to do.
I tried using a controller properly and i Emailed with my diffculties there, so i opted for functionality of the program over endless suffering in a blank white page.
hopefully self explanitory from there.
Thanks!
